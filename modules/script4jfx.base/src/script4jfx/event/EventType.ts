import { Event } from './Event';

/**
 * There are Event classes, i.e. subclasses of Event, that define particular methods for that class.
 * E.g. MouseEvent defines various methods that can be used to query the coordinates of the mouse
 * when the event occurred (getX(), getY(), getSceneX(), getScreenX() etc); ScrollEvent defines methods
 * to query the amount and direction of the scroll: getDeltaX(), getDeltaY(), etc).
 *
 * EventType is a more fine-grained object that specifies what happened. So constants of the EventType
 * class include MOUSE_CLICKED, MOUSE_PRESSED, KEY_TYPED, SCROLL_STARTED, etc. Each of these values
 * is associated with a particular Event subclass.
 *
 * The event registration method is addEventHandler(...). This method takes two parameters: an EventType
 * (which type of event to listen for), and an EventHandler. The EventHandler is generic for obvious
 * reasons: by defining an EventHandler<T extends Event> you get to define a handle(T event) method
 * that takes the appropriate event object, which you can then query in the type-specific way.
 * (E.g. an EventHandler<MouseEvent> has a handle(MouseEvent event) method, which can query the coordinates
 * of the mouse, etc).
 *
 * Now, it clearly only makes sense to register an EventHandler<T> for an EventType that is associated with
 * the Event subclass T. Furthermore, it's desirable to allow for the compiler to enforce this. By making
 * the EventType class generic: EventType<T extends Event>, we get to let the compiler enforce this rule.
 * MOUSE_CLICKED is not just an instance of EventType, it's an instance of EventType<MouseEvent>. Since the
 * signature of the addEventHandler(...) method is addEventHandler(EventType<T>, EventHandler<T>), the
 * compiler enforces that the handler is "for the same class of event" as the event type.
 *
 * When you combine this with using lambdas (or I suppose with type inference, in particular), it becomes
 * quite powerful:
 * node.addEventHandler(MOUSE_CLICKED, e -> {...});
 * Because MOUSE_CLICKED is specifically an EventType<MouseEvent>, the compiler is able to infer that the
 * event handler defined by the lambda is an EventHandler<MouseEvent>, and thus that e is a MouseEvent.
 * So the compiler can now infer that
 *
 * node.addEventHandler(MOUSE_CLICKED, e -> System.out.println(e.getX()));
 * node.addEventHandler(KEY_TYPED, e -> System.out.println(e.getText()));
 * are legal, but
 * node.addEventHandler(MOUSE_CLICKED, e -> System.out.println(e.getText()));
 * is not. If EventType were not generic, this would not be possible.
