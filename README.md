# Script4J
Script4J is an implementation of Java SE API and JavaFX API in TypeScript/JavaScript.

## Java SE Implementation in TypeScript/JavaScript
The core of Script4J is the implementation of Java SE API â€“ base types, errors, collections etc. 

As Script4J is supposed to be used mainly in browsers, not all API will be implemented and multithreading will never 
be supported. Besides, the difference between Java and JavaScript slightly influences on the API.

The target Java SE version is 11.

## JavaFX Implementation in TypeScript/JavaScript
Script4J provides an implementation of JavaFX API on base of web technologies - every `Node` has a `HTML element`, which is 
added to HTML document body. So, Script4J allows to use JavaFX API for building web user interfaces.

There is a demo module that shows using MVVM design pattern. After building the code you will find in `dist` folder 
a HTML document that is the entry point of the demo.

The target JavaFX version is 11.

## Advantages
* Script4J decreases development time as it is very convenient to use the same API for building JavaScript frontend and Java 
backend.
* Script4J makes possible to use the same design patterns, for example MVVM.
* Script4J allows to use the same business services for both web and non web user interfaces without necessity to modify these 
services.
* Script4J increases the quality of the code as Java SE API and JavaFX API are very mature.

## Modules
Java 9 introduced the Java Platform Module System (JPMS). On the other side ECMAScript 2015 introduced JavaScript 
module system. In Script4J, JPMS modules are mapped to JavaScript modules. For example, `Object` class from
`java.base` is located in `script4j.base` module.

However, for development time every class is placed in separate ES2015 class-module for convenience. During code 
building on the base of such class-modules one total module is generated (in `.ts` and `.js`) according to the rules in
`module-info.js` file.

At the same time JPMS module can contain packages, but ES2015 module can't. Because of this it is not possible to have
classes with the same name inside one ES2015 module.

## Code Building
For all commands it is possible to use only `npm run`. To build all:
```
git clone https://github.com/PavelKastornyy/script4j.git
cd script4j
npm run install-all
npm run build-all
```
After it all compiled and modified JavaScript modules can be found in `script4j/dist` folder. TypeScript modules are 
located in `modules/<module-name>/dist` folder.

## Code Testing
Built for production ES2015 module can have much more classes then it exports. So, it is necessary to have another way
to test all classes, even those which are not exported. To do it a special ES2015 module is created for being tested 
and is placed in `modules/<module-name>/tmp` folder. This module exports all the classes it has.

To test all modules run the following command:
```
npm run test-all
```

To test one module run the following commands:
```
cd modules/<module-name>
npm run test-module
```
